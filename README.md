## RudderStack Blog

The RudderStack blog is open-source. We share the best knowledge and experience we have gained about customer data in all its shapes and forms (e.g. customer data platforms, customer data infrastructure, event streaming, analytics, etc.). 

This repository contains the relevant code and markdown source files for [rudderstack.com/blog](https://rudderstack.com/blog/). 

## Contribute

The RudderStack blog is open to contribution. If you have a post that you have written or would like to write about customer data, even if it isn't RudderStack-specific, we would love to have you contribute it to the RudderStack blog. 

Weâ€™re open to contributions in two ways: 
- Open an **issue**:  If you have an idea for a post you'd like to contribute, open an issue with your idea [here](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-blog/issues). That way we can review and give feedback before you spend time and effort writing. Additionally, if you see a post on [rudderstack.com/blog](https://rudderstack.com/blog) that could use an update, you can open an issue. 
- Open a **pull request**:  If you have already written a post that you'd like to contribute, you can raise a pull request with your contribution. 

Every contribution will be reviewed, but not every contribution is guaranteed to be published. If the post is relevant and written well, we will review, give feedback, and publish. 

Get more information on how to contribute [here](CONTRIBUTING.md).
