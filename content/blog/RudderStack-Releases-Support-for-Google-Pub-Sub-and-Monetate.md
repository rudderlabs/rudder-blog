[RudderStack](http://www.rudderstack.com) is proud to announce two new additions to our integrations’ suite – Google Pub/Sub and Monetate. You can now send your real-time customer event data to Google Pub/Sub and Monetate by simply adding them as a destination on the [RudderStack dashboard](http://app.rudderlabs.com/signup?type=freetrial).

**Monetate** helps you conduct an effective product metrics optimization to measure the success of your product in real-time. It guides you in understanding the impact of different A/B tests on the conversion rates and your customers’ overall LTV. 

On the other hand, **Google Pub/Sub** ensures scalable message delivery with a synchronous, cross-zone message replication, and per-message receipt tracking. You can also rewind your backlog to any instant or snapshot to reprocess the messages, or fast-forward for discarding outdated data.

We encourage you to try these integrations and get back to us in case of any issues or bugs. Also, feel free to contact us if you have any suggestions or feedback for improvement.

Why We Added Google Pub/Sub and Monetate as Destinations
--------------------------------------------------------

Google Pub/Sub is a real-time asynchronous messaging service that can act as a messaging middleware for your traditional service integrations or for ingesting and delivering events for your streaming analytics pipeline. This way, it can be a great tool in your data analytics stack. 

By integrating Google Pub/Sub with RudderStack, you can leverage RudderStack’s SDKs to automatically send real-time customer to Google Pub/Sub, allowing you to manage millions of events with low latency. RudderStack seamlessly and efficiently captures all the relevant details about the visiting users and reliably sends the information to Google Pub/Sub. 

On the other hand, using RudderStack’s `track` method, you can send your event data to Monetate using their Engine API. Monetate uses these events to know everything about your customers’ in-product behavior. With their unique A/B testing and hyper-personalization features, Monetate allows you to create tailor-made customer experiences. Monetate also helps you segment audiences based on their behavior, for effective marketing and cross-platform user engagement. 

### What’s next?

We at RudderStack are committed to helping you make the most of your event data via the integrations that we develop. You do not want to miss that important little detail about your customers that makes them keep coming back to your website or app – and we plan on building cutting-edge integrations for RudderStack to help you do just that!
