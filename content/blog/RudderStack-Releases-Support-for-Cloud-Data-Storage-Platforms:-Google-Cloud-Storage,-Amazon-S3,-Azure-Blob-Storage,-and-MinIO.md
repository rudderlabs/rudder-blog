[RudderStack](https://rudderstack.com) is pleased to announce support for four major cloud data storage platforms, namely Google Cloud Storage, Amazon S3, Microsoft Azure Blob Storage, and MinIO. Once you add these as destinations, RudderStack automatically collects the event data. After this, RudderStack stores it into the data buckets as configured on these platforms.

We encourage you to try out these integrations by setting them up as destinations. Feel free to [contact us](https://rudderstack.com/contact/) if you come across any issues or face any bugs. Suggestions and feedback for improvement are, as always, most welcome!  

**Why we Decided to Support Data Storage Platforms as Destinations**
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Safe and reliable data storage is a crucial requirement for building a robust technology stack for any business vertical. Integrating RudderStack with the data storage platforms will allow the marketing and analytics tools to leverage the event data in real-time securely. Thus, businesses can focus their efforts on getting the necessary insights from the event data. As a result, they can stop worrying about procurement and storage.

The way these integrations work is quite simple. You configure the source on the RudderStack dashboard, followed by setting up the desired data platform as the destination. Once the integration is enabled, RudderStack automatically tracks and collects the events sent from the source device or platform. After this, RudderStack stores these events securely into the specified data buckets. There is no manual intervention or configuration required at any stage of this process.  

**What You Can do With the Data Storage Platforms**
---------------------------------------------------

There are many cloud data storage Platforms such as Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, MinIO, and Azure Blob Storage. These platforms specialize in secure, reliable, and scalable data storage in the cloud at a reasonable cost. Businesses work with petabytes of data these days. Hence, having a secure storage platform allows businesses to dump all of their data on it. As a result, they don’t need to worry about the size, scale, or security of the data.

One specialty of these cloud object storage platforms is that once you store the data on these, you can retrieve it from anywhere in the world. Also, these platforms support a variety of data types – ranging from text and CSV files to audio and video. Businesses then use this data for a variety of purposes, including building websites or mobile apps, enterprise applications, or for analytics and business intelligence. Apart from these use-cases, you can also use these data storage platforms for backing up and restoring your data or archiving it for future use.   

**What’s Next**
---------------

RudderStack’s integration with the data storage platforms is quite straightforward and easy, which was our initial goal while designing and developing these integrations. At the same time, we also wanted to implement secure, reliable, and real-time storage of event data in the specified data buckets. RudderStack is committed to ensuring this will be the case for all the data storage platforms. We also have plans to add more platforms to the existing list in the future, so please stay tuned!
