We are pleased to announce RudderStack’s successful integration with VWO, an industry-leader in A/B testing, and improving digital customer experience. This is currently a beta release of the integration, as we plan on testing it more thoroughly and make it production-ready in all scenarios. We have built the integration with VWO to support our native web SDK. Once the integration is complete, you can send relevant events (experiments) from VWO directly to the destinations configured to the source.  

We encourage you to try out this integration and [contact us](https://rudderstack.com/contact/) if you come across any bugs or issues. Suggestions or feedback on how to improve this integration are also most welcome!  

**Why we decided to support A/B testing platforms as destinations for RudderStack**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Customer event data forms the backbone of understanding your customers’ journey on your website and their overall digital experience. As this event data mostly comprises clicks, scrolls, and page views. As A/B testing platforms use this information to help you better understand customer behavior and design your test campaigns/features accordingly, we thought building an integration for such platforms would be only logical.  

By integrating RudderStack with A/B testing platforms such as VWO, you can send track events with the experiment name and details to the configured destinations, such as Google Analytics. This information is beneficial when analyzing the experiment results on different platforms so that they also have information about the experiment variation that the user has seen.  

**What you can do with the A/B testing platforms**
--------------------------------------------------

When it comes to implementing new features on your website, it is generally a good idea to test them thoroughly first. A/B testing platforms allow you to test new website features or campaigns in the form of experiments and measure their performance over time. You can design these tests based on your understanding of the customers’ on-site behavior, including clicks, page scrolls, and average time spent on viewing a page. Tools like VWO offer simple, easy-to-use visual editors to help you design these A/B tests without requiring to write a single line of code.  

The A/B testing platforms also allow you to run multiple A/B tests independently and test the results against your initial hypothesis. Through intuitive reports and dashboards, you can effectively analyze the performance of your campaigns and A/B tests. The results of the analysis help you make informed business decisions to tweak your campaigns or make changes to your product with a very high probability of success. With features such as live previews, you can simulate your experiments for actual website visitors. These platforms also support cross-browser and cross-device testing so that your visitors get the same digital experience across all platforms. Finally, you can also integrate tools such as VWO to other third-party tools such as Google Analytics, Kissmetrics, and more to build a complete marketing stack.  

Enhancing your overall product experience goes a long way in improving customer retention and boosting your overall conversion funnel. A/B testing tools go a long way in helping you understand your customers better and build a successful product.  

**What’s next?**
----------------

While we currently support only VWO as an A/B testing tool, the big picture plan is to support other cutting-edge A/B testing tools and build a strong portfolio of integrations in this domain. Also, we are committed to ensuring that we are compatible with VWO and support their upcoming releases and offerings in the future as well.
