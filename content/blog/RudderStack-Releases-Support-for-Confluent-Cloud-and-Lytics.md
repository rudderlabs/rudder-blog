We’re excited to release support for two new destinations,[ Confluent Cloud](http://confluent.io/confluent-cloud/) and[ Lytics](https://www.lytics.com/) - adding to our rich suite of third-party[ integrations](https://rudderstack.com/integration/).

With these integrations, you can now seamlessly send event data from your preferred data sources to Confluent Cloud and Lytics via[ RudderStack](http://www.rudderstack.com). We urge you to try these integrations and let us know if you face any issues while using them. Any suggestions or feedback for improving these integrations is also welcome!


## **Why we Added Support for Confluent Cloud and Lytics**

At RudderStack, we’re continually looking for popular third-party platforms that businesses use for their data activation use-cases.

Confluent Cloud, an event streaming platform powered by Apache Kafka, has emerged as a widely used tool for building fast and scalable event-driven apps. By integrating Confluent Cloud with RudderStack, you can simplify event data collection, ingestion, and processing and harness the full power of your real-time events. With its multi- and hybrid-cloud features, you can also build multi-cloud data pipelines using Confluent Cloud and bridge your on-premise and cloud data infrastructure without any hassle.

Check out our[ docs](https://docs.rudderstack.com/destinations/confluent-cloud) to read more about the Confluent Cloud integration and how to set it up in  RudderStack.

Lytics, on the other hand, is a Customer Data Platform built especially for marketers. By integrating Lytics with RudderStack, you can leverage the source event data to understand your customers’ overall behavior better and deliver targeted marketing campaigns. You can also improve engagement with your customers through Lytics’ AI-driven personalized messaging feature. When it comes to boosting your marketing ROI and increasing your customers’ lifetime value, Lytics easily stands out from the rest.

You can read our[ docs](https://docs.rudderstack.com/destinations/lytics) to know more about the RudderStack-Lytics integration and how to set it up.


## **What’s Next**

RudderStack’s mission is to help you connect your data sources and destination endpoints while ensuring timely and reliable event delivery. We remain committed to helping you make the most of your customer event data by adding support for more destination platforms. At the same time, we also ensure that our integrations are always up-to-date.
