## Upgrade to RudderStack Pro with just a credit card. No more complicated invoicing processes or mandatory sales calls.

Today, we are announcing the availability of our RudderStack Pro self-serve plans. Now, you can purchase RudderStack Pro, up to 100M events per month, with just a credit card. No complicated invoicing processes and no mandatory discussions with salespeople.

_We also announced our product redesign along with our RudderStack Pro self-serve plans. Read about that in our blog post- [Good Products Deserve Good Design: Introducing the Redesigned RudderStack](https://rudderstack.com/blog/good-products-deserve-good-design-introducing-the-redesigned-rudderstack)._


## Our Self-Serve Plans

All of our self-serve plans give you access to RudderStack Pro (you can learn more about how our Pro tier compares to our Free and Enterprise tiers on [our Pricing page](https://rudderstack.com/pricing/)). We offer three plans based on monthly event volume- monthly, pay-as-you-go, and reduced annual pricing.
