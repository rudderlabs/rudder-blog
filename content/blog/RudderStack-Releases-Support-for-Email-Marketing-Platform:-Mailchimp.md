We at [RudderStack](https://rudderstack.com) are pleased to announce support for Mailchimp, an industry-leading email marketing platform. With this integration, you can add potential leads and customers to your Mailchimp lists via an API call. RudderStack supports sending the event data to Mailchimp via the cloud mode.

We encourage you to try out this integration and [contact us](https://rudderstack.com/contact/) if you come across any queries or issues. We would also appreciate any feedback or suggestions for improvement!   

**Why we Decided to Support an Email Marketing Platform as a Destination**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Email marketing platforms such as Mailchimp specialize in bringing together customer event data with various marketing channels so that companies can promote their business more effectively. RudderStack specializes in tracking, collecting, and routing event data securely. Integration with email marketing platforms such as Mailchimp helps businesses streamline their overall data procurement process. This means that you can focus purely on email marketing tasks and designing personalized ads. So, you don’t have to worry about how the system tracks and collects the data.

With RudderStack, you can capture all the details related to your users and their associated features through an identify call. Every time you make a call, RudderStack also checks if the email address associated with a user has already subscribed to the configured Mailchimp list. RudderStack also ensures that the already subscribed users are not re-subscribed. You can read more about how RudderStack-Mailchimp integration features in our [detailed documentation](https://docs.rudderstack.com/destinations/mailchimp).  

**What You Can do With an Email Marketing Platform**
----------------------------------------------------

Email marketing platforms such as Mailchimp allow you to understand your audience better and help you build personalized email and ad campaigns to boost your conversion funnel. It offers customizable tools such as intuitive sign-up forms, landing pages, social posts, as well as advertisements to get new contacts as well as implement efficient retargeting.

Email marketing tools like Mailchimp allow you to build a list of similar customers or leads. So it becomes easier for you to promote your business or product to a specific group of audiences. Mailchimp automatically segments your customers based on their overall website or in-app behavior. It also gives you the flexibility to personalize email campaigns for them. Through built-in analytics and real-time reports, Mailchimp also allows you to monitor and measure the performance of these campaigns. As a result, you know precisely what is working for you.  

**What’s Next**
---------------

We at RudderStack are always on the lookout for the latest and most popular tools in the email marketing domain. We already support the latest Mailchimp features – including working with custom merge fields, overriding Mailchimp list IDs, and more. Integration with Mailchimp is just the start – we are committed to adding more destinations in this space. We also aim to ensure that RudderStack supports all the latest and most up to date features these destinations have to offer.
