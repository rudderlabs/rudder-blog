## Why we Added Zendesk and Zendesk Chat as Cloud Extract Sources

RudderStack continually strives to add support for more Cloud Extract Sources that customers love and use.

[Zendesk](https://docs.rudderstack.com/cloud-extract-sources/zendesk) is a popular customer support service platform that enables you to track sales and effectively engage with your customers. It offers a modern sales CRM, a smart, self-serve knowledge base, and analytics and reporting capabilities to understand your customers better. 

Check out our [documentation](https://docs.rudderstack.com/cloud-extract-sources/zendesk) to read more about the Zendesk Cloud Extract Source and how to set it up in RudderStack. 

[Zendesk Chat](https://docs.rudderstack.com/cloud-extract-sources/zendesk-chat) is a live chat platform that lets you connect with your customers via live chats and instant messaging in real-time. It enables you to deliver rich, personalized user experiences across both Web and mobile. 

Check out our [documentation](https://docs.rudderstack.com/cloud-extract-sources/zendesk-chat) to read more about the Zendesk Chat Cloud Extract Source and how to set it up in RudderStack. 

RudderStack already supports [Zendesk as a destination](https://rudderstack.com/integration/zendesk/), enabling you to ingest customer data from different sources and send them to data warehouses or third-party customer tools for activation use cases. 

By adding Zendesk as a source, you can collect the Zendesk and Zendesk Chat data and route it to supported [data warehouses](https://docs.rudderstack.com/data-warehouse-integrations) (Snowflake, Google BigQuery, etc.) or other [customer tools](https://docs.rudderstack.com/destinations) (Salesforce, HubSpot, Intercom, and so on) for further analysis. 



## How do our Customers use it?

Cloud Extracts allow you to combine and send data from your different teams (product, sales, marketing, or support) to your data warehouse or route them to other destinations. This helps you to surface answers to more complicated, nuanced business questions. 

With Zendesk, customers easily pull information on support tickets, combine them with the product usage behavior data collected using RudderStack [Event Streams](https://docs.rudderstack.com/rudderstack-event-streams) in their warehouse for analysis. 

Suppose the analysis helps you identify a few indicators of _likely to churn_ cohort. You can use RudderStack's [Warehouse Actions](https://rudderstack.com/blog/rudderstack-warehouse-actions-unlocks-the-data-in-your-warehouse) to pull that cohort of users back via RudderStack as identify calls and update user profiles in all of your downstream customer tools. This gives your teams the ability to identify and take action on customers who have a higher likelihood of churning.


## What's Next?

RudderStack will continue adding support for newer Cloud Extract sources and ensure that our integrations are always up-to-date. We also conduct [live Q&A webinars](https://resources.rudderstack.com/rudderstack-webinar-registration) with our customers to share their experiences of using different RudderStack features.
