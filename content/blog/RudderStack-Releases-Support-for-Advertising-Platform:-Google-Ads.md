We are pleased to announce that RudderStack now supports integration with Google Ads – the world’s most popular online advertising platform. You can now use RudderStack’s APIs to directly send customer event data to Google Ads by simply configuring Google Ads as a destination in the RudderStack UI.

We encourage you to try out this integration and get back to us in case of any queries or issues. If you have any suggestions or feedback for improvement, please feel free to [contact us](https://sso.secureserver.net/?realm=pass&app=ox&saas=0&region=am2). We would be pleased to talk with you.   

**Why we Decided to Support an Advertising Platform as a Destination for RudderStack**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Advertising platforms make extensive use of customer event data to help you create tailored ads that suit your specific business needs. This event data mainly comprises of the users’ clicks and page loads. RudderStack specializes in tracking, collecting, and routing such event data from a host of different sources to the desired destinations. In such a scenario, integration with advertising platforms would mean businesses can get the most up-to-date data on the customer click events as well as page loads for their advertising needs.  

RudderStack makes use of the Google Ads SDK called gtag.js, which is essentially a JavaScript framework that tracks and sends data related to page loads and clicks to Google Ads. Before sending the data, RudderStack also maps the relevant properties of certain events to the support fields of Google Ads. For example, RudderStack automatically maps and assigns the `property.currency` field to the currency field of Google Ads. This ensures that once Google Ads receives the data, it can be picked up directly for analysis and strategizing rather than cleaning and readying it first.  

**What you can do With an Advertising Platform**
------------------------------------------------

Digital advertising platforms have completely revolutionized how people do their business these days. From increasing their overall business volume to improving their brand value, advertising platforms have become a key component of today’s digital marketplace.   

Digital advertising platforms such as Google Ads allow you to associate your business with specific keywords related to it. By doing so, anyone searching for those keywords is directed to your website or blog. This can help you boost your online sales, drive your website traffic, or get more customers on your door. Tools like Google Ads integrate seamlessly with other Google services such as Maps, which helps potential customers to locate your business on the map and visit you.  

With advertising platforms such as Google Ads, you can design intelligent ads that identify and target the right customer base. It also allows you to measure your ad campaigns to see what’s working and what’s not. Through real-time reports, you get all the insights you need to improve your ads over time and increase their effectiveness.  

**What’s Next**
---------------

Our aim at RudderStack is to develop integrations for all the leading advertising platforms out there so that businesses can integrate RudderStack with them and get the most out of their event data. We have plans to develop enterprise-ready integrations for other popular platforms such as Twitter Ads and Facebook App Events. In the case of Google Ads, we are committed to ensuring that you can send your event data for effective advertising without having to worry about version incompatibility.
