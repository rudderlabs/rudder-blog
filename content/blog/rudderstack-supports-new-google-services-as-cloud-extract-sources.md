RudderStack is excited to announce support for a few new Google Services - [Google Sheets](https://rudderstack.com/integration/google-sheets-source/), [Google Ads](https://rudderstack.com/integration/google-ads-source/), and [Google Search Console](https://rudderstack.com/integration/google-search-console-source/) - as Cloud Extract Sources. 

**[Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/)** is a popular cloud-based spreadsheet platform that lets you create and format your spreadsheets and share them with other people simultaneously. 

**[Google Ads](https://ads.google.com/)** is an online advertising platform that helps your product or service reach the masses through online ads. It also lets you connect to prospective buyers interested in your products or services. 

**[Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/welcome)** (previously known as Google Webmasters) is a web service that lets you optimize your site's presence on the Google Search results.

## Why we Added These Google Services as Cloud Extract Sources

[Google Sheets](https://docs.rudderstack.com/cloud-extract-sources/google-sheets), [Google Ads](https://docs.rudderstack.com/cloud-extract-sources/google-adwords), and [Google Search Console](https://docs.rudderstack.com/cloud-extract-sources/google-search-console) are powerful yet simple Google services mostly used by many small to large-scale businesses to improve their day-to-day activities and their brand's awareness online.  

Also, by adding these Google Services as a source, you can easily import your specified customer data into your warehouse or send them to third parties for further analytics. Processed using Google's machine learning and AI capabilities, the data gathered from these sources can help you unlock additional insights when further processed within your analytics pipeline. These insights enable you to sketch solutions for complex workflows and nuanced business questions.


## How do our Customers use it?

Here are a few uses cases of using the above Google Services as a source:

**Set up data import schedule**: These sources enable customers to fetch data on a specified schedule and frequency. This allows different teams to maintain and update their data, minimizing the need to access the web portal frequently.  

**Collaborate with different teams**: Customers aggregate data from different customer teams like the product, sales, marketing, or support, to answer complicated business questions. 

**Combine data from different platforms:** Users combine data from websites, mobile apps, and servers to understand overall user conversion and predict long-term user engagements. 

    


## What's Next?

At RudderStack, our primary goal is to ensure the secure delivery of your customer events to your warehouse or your favorite third-party platforms. We also look forward to adding support for more cloud extract sources soon to help you connect your data with platforms that you love.

We also support different event streams, SDKs, and over 80 destination integrations. You can also check out the other [integrations](https://rudderstack.com/integration/) we support.
