Integrating with these destinations enables you to send your customer event data from different sources to these destinations via [RudderStack](http://www.rudderstack.com/) and get full flexibility and control over your event data.  

[Sign up](https://app.rudderstack.com/signup) for free today to try these destinations. We'd love to get your feedback via email or [Slack](https://resources.rudderstack.com/join-rudderstack-slack)!  


## Why we Decided to Support These Integrations

[Salesforce Marketing Cloud](https://rudderstack.com/integration/salesforce-marketing-cloud/) is marketing automation and analytics platform. It enables you to understand your customer better through email, mobile, social and online marketing. With the combination of AI, Marketing Cloud enables personalized communication and design intuitive marketing campaigns to engage them throughout their product journey.

[Klaviyo](https://rudderstack.com/integration/klaviyo/) is a powerful eCommerce platform that helps deliver personalized experiences across different marketing channels and boost your business revenue. It enables you to easily track and measure all your user activity, increase engagement across devices and channels to drive revenue and customer loyalty. If you're looking for an eCommerce marketing tool, Klaviyo is a preferable choice for you.  


## How do Our Customers Use it?


### Engage With Customers in Near Real-Time With Salesforce Marketing Cloud 


[Salesforce Marketing Cloud](https://docs.rudderstack.com/destinations/sfmc) helps convert user actions to useful insights within minutes. This helps customers immediately connect with their users and capture all the user actions simultaneously. It also allows customers to segment captured data to get the right insights to the right user at the right time. 


### Robust Data Visualization With Klaviyo

[Klaviyo](https://docs.rudderstack.com/destinations/klaviyo) allows customers to gather campaign metrics and make quick decisions based on daily e-mail performance. It allows customers to get a 360-visibility of what their e-mails are doing for their business. Klaviyo allows you to easily track and measure all your user activity alongside the resulting revenue and get a further breakdown of this revenue based on custom attributes such as campaign type or revenue per recipient. So, all your data is easily accessible and easy to build reports on.


## What's Next?

RudderStack is an open-source product, and we will love creating integrations that help you ease your customer workflows. We are continuously working on adding more destinations soon. We currently support over 80 [destinations](https://docs.rudderstack.com/destinations) and add a new one every two weeks, so be sure to explore the other [integrations](https://rudderstack.com/integration/) we offer.
