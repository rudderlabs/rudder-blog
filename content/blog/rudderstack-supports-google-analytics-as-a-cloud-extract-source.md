We're excited to share that [RudderStack](http://www.rudderstack.com) now supports Google Analytics as a Cloud Extract source. With this addition, you can seamlessly ingest your customer event data and route it to your data warehouse or your favorite third-party destinations. 

We recently announced [support for Google Analytics 4](https://rudderstack.com/blog/rudderstack-adds-support-for-google-analytics-4-as-a-destination), the latest property of GA, as a destination. RudderStack's Google Analytics Cloud Extract source helps you easily integrate your analytics data with other warehouses and destinations through RudderStack. All of this without worrying about additional coding or implementation.

Sign up for free to try out the Cloud Extract source integration, and if you do, we'd be happy to get your feedback via email or [Slack](https://resources.rudderstack.com/join-rudderstack-slack)! 


## Why we Added Google Analytics as a Cloud Extract Source

Google Analytics is a popular web analytics platform used by many companies for keeping track of their day-to-day analytics. It helps you unlock unique insights into your marketing performance, content, and products and services to better understand your customer. 

Let's say you want to use specific data from Google Analytics as an input to generate or fuel further analytics for your business. You might also want to record or store specific analytics data within your warehouse. However, sending analytics data to your warehouse or other platforms involves writing scripts to identify/access, extract, and transform the data, which requires multiple complex steps.

Google Analytics Source allows you to collect raw events and data securely and easily into RudderStack. You can then send this event data- with or without transformation- into your data warehouse or your favorite destinations such as [ActiveCampaign](https://www.activecampaign.com/), [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), PostHog, and many more for analytics or other activation use-cases.

For detailed information, check out our [docs](https://docs.rudderstack.com/cloud-extract-sources/google-analytics) on Google Analytics as a cloud extract source.


## What's Next?

RudderStack constantly strives to deliver your customer events to your favorite destinations securely. We are committed to helping you make the most of your customer event data by adding support for more cloud source platforms in the coming months.
