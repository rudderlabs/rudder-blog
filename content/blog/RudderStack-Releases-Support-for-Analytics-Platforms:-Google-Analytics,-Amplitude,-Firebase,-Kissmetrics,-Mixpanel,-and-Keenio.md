RudderStack is happy to announce its successful integration with some of the leading analytics platforms out there – namely Google Analytics, Amplitude, Mixpanel, Firebase, Keen.io, and Kissmetrics. We have built these integrations to support our web-native SDKs as well as the cloud mode. In the cloud mode, the event data is sent directly to the RudderStack servers, which transform and route the data to these platforms in the desired format. For Firebase, we have released the [Android](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-integration-firebase-android) and [iOS](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-integration-firebase-ios) native SDKs so that you can send your event data directly from your mobile devices for seamless analytics.  

We encourage you to try out these integrations and feel free to contact us if you come across any bugs or issues. We would also love to get suggestions and feedback related to these integrations from you.  

**Why we decided to support analytics platforms as destinations for RudderStack**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Analytics is undoubtedly at the heart of using customer event data effectively. Businesses use the insights obtained from their customer event data to make meaningful and actionable marketing decisions, such as retargeting their ad campaigns or optimizing their product. RudderStack’s integration with the leading analytics platforms is thus a logical step in ensuring that the businesses can use our customer data infrastructure in the best way possible.   

By integrating RudderStack with the analytics platforms, you don’t have to worry about how the data is tracked and collected. Also, RudderStack collects the event data from the sources in real-time so that it is always up to date. It also ensures that the format and structure of the data meets the destinations’ requirements. So you can now focus on getting the insights out of the data rather than worry about transforming it and make it ready for analytics.

**What you can do with the analytics platforms**
------------------------------------------------

In today’s world, how businesses leverage data to shape their overall business strategy determines their ability to compete in the market. Analytics platforms such as Google Analytics, Amplitude, Mixpanel, and others allow you to get crucial insights on how you can shape your product or marketing strategy. These platforms make use of the event data to understand your customers’ behavior on your app/website in the best possible way. They help you track the overall conversion funnel and identify areas where most of the users are bound to drop off. The resulting insights allow you to optimize your product for better user experience. You can also build targeted campaigns for these users and boost your ROI.  

From a marketing perspective, the analytics platforms help you identify campaigns that are bringing in the most users, as well those not performing as per your expectations. You can then tweak these campaigns based on the product and customer insights to ensure they give you the desired results.  

Most importantly, these analytics tools are designed with marketers and product managers as their primary audience. Powered by intuitive drag-and-drop features, visually appealing dashboards, and highly presentable reports, these tools eliminate the need to learn complicated coding to use them effectively.

**What’s next?**
----------------

RudderStack’s seamless integration with the analytics platforms allows you to get the most out of your event data. That said, we are committed to being in complete sync with these platforms as they evolve with new offerings and features. On the enterprise front, there are plans to add specific eCommerce event tracking capabilities, but this will ultimately depend on our customer’s requirements.
