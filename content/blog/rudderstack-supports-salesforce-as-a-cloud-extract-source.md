## Why we Added Salesforce as a Source

Salesforce is a popular SaaS-based CRM platform helping companies to streamline their sales and marketing operations effectively. Adding Salesforce as a source can take your company's analysis to the next level. Import analytics-ready data with a simple click - no coding or scripting required.

Salesforce offers a single source of truth for your sales, marketing, and other teams through a comprehensive view of your customers, their activities, key decisions, contacts, and much more. Every user action data is analyzed to provide predictive analytics and other AI capabilities to its customers.

By adding Salesforce as a source, you can easily import your Salesforce customer data into your warehouse or send them to third parties for other necessary analytics. With your entire CRM data, you can go beyond your dashboard capabilities to get additional insights such as calculating qualified leads over time and much more. 

You can also combine data from mobile apps and websites with Salesforce data to determine user behavior across multiple customer touchpoints. Merge data from other touchpoints and perform [lead segmentation](https://www.salesforce.com/products/marketing-cloud/best-practices/email-audience-segmentation/) to make better sales decisions. Combine Salesforce data with the helpdesk to provide your sales team with a timeline of customer actions.
