We are pleased to announce the successful integration of [RudderStack](https://rudderstack.com) with Intercom – the industry-leading business messaging platform today. You can now send your customer event data to Intercom directly through RudderStack’s server or our native [Android](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-integration-intercom-android) or [iOS](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-integration-intercom-ios) SDKs by calling the relevant APIs.

We encourage you to try this integration and get back to us in case of any issues or bugs. Also, feel free to contact us if you have any suggestions or feedback for improvement.  

**Why we Decided to Support a Business Messaging Platform as a Destination**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Critical use-cases of event data are lead generation and tracking your overall conversion funnel. We believe that by integrating RudderStack with business messaging platforms such as Intercom, we can simplify the whole process. RudderStack tracks and collects customer event data across web and mobile devices in real-time, which is ideal for tools like Intercom to create useful leads. Businesses can use Intercom to then engage with these leads and improve their overall conversion through active engagement. 

RudderStack offers server-to-sever as well as device mode support to send event data to Intercom. In case you want RudderStack to track and collect event data from your source mobile devices, you have to add Intercom to your project. RudderStack’s Android or iOS SDK will ensure that the event data with the information related to the users, as well as their activities, are tracked, collected, and routed to Intercom in real-time.  

**What You Can do With a Business Messaging Platform**
------------------------------------------------------

Building effective, long-lasting customer relationships goes a long way in establishing a successful business. Business messaging platforms allow you to understand how your customers interact with your website or app. These platforms also help you identify which aspects of your product need improvement by following the drop-off in the overall funnel. They also allow for efficient lead generation, better customer retention through personalized messaging, and active customer support.  

Business messaging platforms such as Intercom allow you to:

*   Track customer lifecycle and your overall conversion funnel
*   Identify your best leads and convert them to potential customers through effective engagement
*   Send personalized onboarding and engagement messages to your leads as well as existing customers
*   Get real-time insights to ensure quick, satisfactory customer support and improve overall customer experience

**What’s Next**
---------------

RudderStack currently supports Intercom v1.4. Work is in progress to support their Intercom v2.0 API, and we are committed to doing this at the earliest. Also, we are working hard to add more business messaging platforms as supported integrations. Please stay tuned!
