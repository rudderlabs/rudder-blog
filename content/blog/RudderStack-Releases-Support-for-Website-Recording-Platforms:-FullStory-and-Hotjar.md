We are pleased to announce RudderStack’s successful integration with FullStory and Hotjar. FullStory and Hotjar offer rich website recording, behavioral analytics, and digital experience capabilities. You can easily integrate RudderStack with these platforms using our native web SDKs. Once integrated, you can use our SDK to send customer event data directly to FullStory. Hotjar automatically tracks user data related to page visits and their activity, so there is no need to call any of the page or track methods explicitly.  

Please feel free to try out these integrations and contact us if you come across any bugs or issues. Suggestions and feedback are welcome, as always!  

**Why we decided to support website recording platforms as destinations for RudderStack**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A customer’s overall website activity constitutes the lion’s share of the event data that RudderStack tracks, collects, and routes to the specified destinations. The website recording platforms use this data to identify the customer’s overall journey and identify points where the customer drops off in the conversion funnel. By integrating RudderStack with these platforms, we want to ensure that the customers are able to get the most out of their event data.  

The manner in which this integration works is quite simple. RudderStack takes care of ensuring that the event data across your source devices reaches the desired destination in the format that it expects in real-time. The platforms then pick up this data and use it to study the customer’s overall product journey and use the insights to enhance their digital experience. As mentioned before, platforms like Hotjar auto-track all the user data. So there is no need for any manual coding or adding any custom web-hooks to get the event data across.  

**What you can do with the website recording platforms**
--------------------------------------------------------

As mentioned before, website recording platforms make use of the event data to help you understand your customers better. This includes every click, mouse scroll as well as any dynamic state change. Tools like FullStory and Hotjar derive insights from this information and identify specific areas in your product where customers are facing the most issues or are simply losing interest and dropping off the conversion funnel. These crucial details allow you to improve your product accordingly and ensure a better customer experience.  

The website recording tools also offer unique and game-changing features such as session replays and heatmap recordings. These features help you replay and better understand your customers’ overall product journey. By visually representing their clicks and scrolling behavior, they help you pinpoint any usability issues that your users are likely to encounter and eliminate any guesswork in the process. Tools like Hotjar also offer features such as feedback polls, which help you understand what the customers want from your product, and what is preventing them from getting it.  

When it comes to building a full-fledged marketing stack for your business, tools such as FullStory and Hotjar are absolutely essential to have. They fit perfectly for all your marketing needs, with multi-platform support, ease of use, and absolutely no prior coding expertise to use them.  

**What’s next?**
