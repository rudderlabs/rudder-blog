We at [RudderStack](https://rudderstack.com/) are happy to announce support for Kochava, Adjust, AppsFlyer, and Branch – the leading mobile attribution platforms in the market today. You can now configure your mobile devices with our SDKs, which are available for both Android and iOS, and seamlessly send your event data to these platforms for attribution.  

We encourage you to try out these integrations by cloning their [GitHub](https://github.com/rudderlabs) repositories. Bugs, suggestions, and pull requests are welcome!  

**Why we decided to support mobile attribution platforms as destinations for RudderStack**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mobile attribution and in-app analytics are two of the most critical use-cases of event data. To implement them successfully, the data that flows into the platform needs to be well-structured and real-time. RudderStack specializes in tracking and collecting event data as it arrives across all your source devices. It then sends the data to the destinations configured by you. RudderStack also ensures that the structure of the event data meets the destinations’ requirements so that the data is not out of place and does not require any transformation.  

RudderStack makes mobile attribution **easier** and more **efficient**. By integrating RudderStack with the mobile attribution platforms, you can pick up the data that is already collected for you and use it to optimize your marketing campaigns.  

**What you can do with the mobile attribution platforms**
---------------------------------------------------------

The mobile attribution providers such as Kochava, Adjust, AppsFlyer and Branch give you the perfect platform to understand how the customers arrive at your app and what they do once they arrive. You can identify the ad campaigns that are bringing in the most visitors and use them more efficiently for better targeting. At the same time, the not-so-well performing campaigns can be tweaked or dropped entirely.  

Also, the attribution platforms record each activity performed by the customer once they are on your app as a unique data point in real-time. The mobile attribution platforms allow you to understand this data better to make meaningful business decisions related to optimizing your app for better user experience and marketability.   

**What’s next?**
----------------

As the mobile attribution platforms keep evolving with best-in-class features and new functionalities, we at RudderStack are committed to keeping pace with them. Our goal is to ensure that the data sent to these platforms are reliable and always up-to-date. Although RudderStack already supports the major API calls to send event data to these attribution platforms, we aim to add more flexibility and ease with you can do so.
