We're happy to announce support for [Salesforce Pardot](https://docs.rudderstack.com/cloud-extract-sources/salesforce-pardot) as a Cloud Extract Source and [Google Sheets](https://docs.rudderstack.com/destinations/google-sheets) as a Destination. 

RudderStack already supports [Google Sheets as a Cloud Extract Source](https://docs.rudderstack.com/cloud-extract-sources/google-sheets) that connects your customer events from Google Sheets with your warehouse or your preferred third-party customer tools.

[Sign up](https://app.rudderstack.com/signup) for free to try Pardot and Google Sheets, and if you do, we'd love to get your feedback via email or [Slack](https://resources.rudderstack.com/join-rudderstack-slack)! 


## Why we Decided to Add Support for These Integrations

[Salesforce Pardot](https://rudderstack.com/integration/salesforce-pardot-source/) marketing automation tool lets businesses engage with potential customers, build valuable relationships, and drive increased conversion. It also offers various tools to assist sales teams in closing more deals.

Adding Salesforce Pardot as a Cloud Extract Source enables you to send all your customer events to your data warehouse. RudderStack also allows sending these events to your downstream customer tools for further analytics. 

[Google Sheets](https://rudderstack.com/integration/google-sheets/) is a free, cloud-based spreadsheet application that allows users to create and format spreadsheets and share them online to collaborate with other people. It allows multiple users to view and edit files simultaneously and in real-time.

Google Sheets is widely adopted by multiple companies, both big and small. Adding it to destinations will allow you to save time and effort as Rudderstack collects all your events from your different sources and send them to Google Sheets in the desired format.


## How do Our Customers Use It?
