RudderStack is delighted to announce three new destinations, DigitalOcean Spaces, TVSquared, and Heap Analytics.  
  
You can send your customer event data seamlessly to TVSquared for TV attribution, and Heap Analytics for real-time analytics. If you are looking to store and serve huge amounts of data, DigitalOcean Spaces integration platform would just be the right option for you.  
  
We encourage you to try these integrations and get back to us in case of any issues or bugs. Also, feel free to [contact us](mailto:contact@rudderstack.com) if you have any suggestions or feedback for improvement.

Why we Added These as Destinations
----------------------------------

RudderStack promises to deliver your events securely to your desired destinations. We continually strive to partner with integrations that customers love; the one that handles their problems with data and analytics with ease. 

### DigitalOcean Spaces

DigitalOcean solves the problem of storing massive data with Spaces, its S3-compatible object storage service. It has a free CDN to reduce the latency and deliver content faster when loading frequently accessed content by up to 70 percent to increase overall site or app performance. By integrating Spaces with RudderStack, you can send your event data to Spaces to seamlessly host video, photo, or audio assets on its scalable and highly-available infrastructure without worrying about the size or space.

### TVSquared

Similarly, if you are a brand company and want to analyze your brand’s impact across TV, RudderStack’s TVSquared integration is the right choice for you. It allows companies to analyze, measure, and optimize responses generated across TV everywhere. With RudderStack, you can send your customer event data to TVSquared to understand your brand’s overall performance – from offline spend to online sales, and how you can enhance your on-air campaigns. 

### Heap Analytics

Heap Analytics helps you to track and analyze customer interactions with your website or mobile applications. Your customer success teams can identify what drives conversions, customer pain points, and so on to formulate innovative customer retention methods. By integrating Heap Analytics as a destination in RudderStack, you can aggregate all customer data from different sources along with additional properties associated with your events and route them to Heap analytics for further processing.
