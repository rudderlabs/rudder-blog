We're delighted to announce support for a new source, [AppsFlyer](https://rudderstack.com/integration/appsflyer-source/), and two new destinations, [Appcues](https://rudderstack.com/integration/appcues/), and [Userlist](https://rudderstack.com/integration/userlist/). 

RudderStack already supports [AppsFlyer as a destination](https://rudderstack.com/integration/appsflyer/). We added support for AppsFlyer as a source, where you can directly send the events captured by AppsFlyer to RudderStack. You can forward these events to your desired destinations for further analytics and useful insights.

RudderStack also supports sending your real-time customer event data to the two new destinations, Appcues and Userlist. With the addition of newer destinations every week, we also offer you full flexibility and control over your event data.  

We encourage you to try these integrations, and feel free to contact us for questions, feedback, or issues to report. You can also start a conversation on these integrations on our [Slack](https://resources.rudderstack.com/join-rudderstack-slack) channel. We'd be happy to chat with you!




## Why we Decided to Support These Integrations



RudderStack promises seamless and reliable delivery of events from your preferred sources to your favorite destinations.

[Appcues](https://www.appcues.com/) is a popular product marketing software that helps in the easy and personalized onboarding of your customers. It lets you create product tours, walkthroughs, in-app messages, surveys, and so on, without any coding.

 

[Userlist](https://userlist.com/), on the other hand, is a messaging platform to onboard and engage your SaaS customers through targeting behavior-based campaigns. You can trigger marketing campaigns based on what users do in your product. It lets you choose the right communication channel (email or in-app messaging) for each message.

 

Next, adding [AppsFlyer](https://www.appsflyer.com/) as a source allows you to send your customer events from AppsFlyer to RudderStack. You need to add an endpoint that points to RudderStack with the AppsFlyer Push API option. AppsFlyer Source integration also allows you to capture events, including reattribution, in-app install events, etc., and send these to RudderStack.



## What's Next?


RudderStack is an [open-source product](https://rudderstack.com/blog/rudderstack-an-open-source-customer-data-infrastructure-podcast-with-soumyadeb-mitra/). We will continue to develop a vast array of supported integrations to ease your day-to-day work. We are working diligently to add more sources and destinations soon.

We support over 80 destinations and add a new one every two weeks, so be sure to check out all of the other [integrations](https://rudderstack.com/integration/) we support.
