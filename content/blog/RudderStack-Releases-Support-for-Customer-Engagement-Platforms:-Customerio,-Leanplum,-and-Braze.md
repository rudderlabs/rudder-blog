[RudderStack](https://rudderstack.com/) is pleased to announce its successful integration with three of the most popularly used targeted marketing and customer engagement platforms for the mobile and web. We now support Customer.io, Leanplum, and Braze. RudderStack allows you to send your customer event data to these platforms in two ways. You can send your data through the Server-to-Server cloud mode. You can also send event data through our dedicated SDKs for native web, iOS, and Android.

Please feel free to check out our GitHub repository and try out these integrations. If you come across any issues or bugs, you can contact us. Any suggestions or feedback for improvement are welcome.  

**Why we decided to support customer engagement platforms as destinations**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

We believe that integrating RudderStack with targeted marketing platforms would help businesses get the most out of their event data. Through RudderStack’s SDKs, you can track and collect data related to user activity. You can collect user activities such as their clicks, page views, and other associated information. RudderStack then routes all this information to these platforms in real-time and in a format they expect. So you can use the platforms to understand your customers better and get the insights you need. You can use this information to build more personalized ads, email campaigns, and push notifications. 

The ultimate goal of any business is to boost its ROI and improve its overall conversion funnel. RudderStack’s seamless integration with customer engagement platforms such as Customer.io, Leanplum, and Braze allows you to do just that.  

**What you can do with these platforms**
----------------------------------------

Customer engagement platforms such as Customer.io, Leanplum, and Braze segment your audiences based on their behavior. Their browsing patterns, order and subscription history, and their overall interaction with your website or app constitute this behavior. These tools help you leverage useful insights from this behavior and design targeted campaigns, as well as SMS, email, and push notifications straight to their devices. The purpose of these personalized campaigns is two-fold – improve overall engagement as the ads are better suited to their needs, as well as increase the chances of retention.

Besides improving engagement, these tools also allow you to measure the effectiveness of your campaigns and make the necessary changes where there is room for improvement. Companies build these tools with marketing teams and product managers in mind, so their campaign builders are very intuitive, easy to use, and involve no coding complexities. With strict data privacy and regulation laws in place, these tools also ensure that your data is used in a 100% safe manner.

Powered by immersive UX and rich analytics capabilities, these customer engagement and mobile marketing tools go a long way in boosting your ROI and increasing your overall brand value.  

**What’s next?**
----------------

We at RudderStack are always on the lookout for the latest developments in customer engagement and mobile marketing platforms. Apart from version compatibility, we are committed to ensuring to support the new and upcoming features in these tools.
