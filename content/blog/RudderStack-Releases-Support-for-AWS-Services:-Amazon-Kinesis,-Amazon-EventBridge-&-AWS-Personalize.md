We’re pleased to announce that [RudderStack](http://www.rudderstack.com/) now supports three more AWS services – namely Amazon Kinesis, EventBridge, and Personalize. By adding these as destinations, you can seamlessly send data from your different event sources for further data processing and analysis.

Amazon Kinesis can gulp down large volumes of streaming data and process data to offer real-time data optimization solutions. It is highly scalable and can handle data from gazillion sources with lower latencies.

With Amazon EventBridge, you can connect different applications using data from various sources –SaaS applications, AWS services, or even your applications. You can also collect streams of real-time data and route them to your preferred endpoints for data computation. 

As the name suggests, AWS Personalize, helps you create a highly personalized product, content, and marketing recommendations. Personalize uses the latest Machine learning algorithms to fire up real-time recommendations, thus, boosting customer engagement and the overall revenue.

We encourage you to try these integrations and get back to us in case of any issues or bugs. Also, feel free to contact us if you have any suggestions or feedback for improvement.  

Why We Added these AWS Services as Destinations?  

---------------------------------------------------

At the bottom line, Amazon Kinesis, Amazon EventBridge, and AWS Personalize allow real-time data streaming from your customer events to leverage meaningful insights for your business and maintain customer relationships.

Amazon Kinesis is easy-to-use and does not require manual infrastructure administration. By integrating Amazon Kinesis as a destination, you can dump data collected from various data sources directly into the Kinesis stream. RudderStack makes it easy to set up Amazon Kinesis with just AWS credentials configured into your machine. We want you to get the best out of event data, and Kinesis helps you do just. It ingests real-time data from video, audio, application logs, website clickstreams, etc. for machine learning, analytics, and other applications.

Amazon EventBridge, also known as a serverless Event Bus, delivers your event data from your dedicated sources to the computing destinations of your choice with high security and error handling. RudderStack helps you easily set up EventBridge integration by skipping through the manual coding. It also ensures the timely and reliable delivery of your event data to EventBridge via all your sources. 

AWS Personalize helps provide recommendations based on your users’ viewing history. You can also strategize targeted marketing campaigns, promotions, and even customized search results. Personalize helps you track your users’ activity data in real-time and helps offer personalized product recommendations to your customers based on their shopping history and other interests. RudderStack collects event data from a variety of data sources and routes it securely to Personalize.
