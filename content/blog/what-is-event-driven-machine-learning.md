Machine learning represents the detailed study of numerous complex computer algorithms, which are automatically boosted through both obtained experience and the continuous use of data. Essentially, it’s how AI gets better over time.

Machine learning algorithms will build a model based on sample data to decide or predict without being explicitly programmed. This sample is also known as **training data**, and it’s the key to any precise analysis.

The highly modern technology is mostly used in healthcare, where diagnostics are predicted for doctors’ reviews. The sentiment analysis that tech giants are doing on social media is another interesting way to apply machine learning, fraud detection in the finance sector, and predicting customer churn in eCommerce.

Buckle up, and let’s dive deeper into the essence of machine learning, its overall impact on technology and businesses, and its core industry applications. 


## Better Software with Machine Learning

The possibility of machine learning has introduced new encouraging abilities in the software engineering world. All types of software applications are personal assistants trained to answer predetermined questions such as _Will these types of customers purchase that kind of products?_ Earlier, the only way to build software was to code human-defined rules for a specific application whose purpose was to answer those particular questions. Back in those “ancient” times, the human operator had to tell the software how to calculate the probability of a specific customer purchasing a certain product!

However, instead of giving the software a specific command on doing a certain calculation, we can now provide precedents from the past using machine learning. Now, the software can make thorough data analysis and come up with its own rules. This entire process is what we now call “learning”.

Data is the most crucial element in the process of machine learning. The overall data quality will decide the software-defined rules and their quality. If the required information is not met, the software will not find the correct answers. Answering the question about getting the most data is the key to leveraging the power of machine learning.


## Event-Driven Data Collection

The initial and essential step in any data science project is data collection. There are numerous ways when it comes to collecting data - from one or many sources. Sometimes it is hard to have direct entry to essential but sensitive information when working with enterprises. Many times, data scientists need to request data dumps. This implementation may prevent accidents, but it separates ongoing projects and enterprise reality. It averts teams from having real-time data access. It also requires activating various bureaucratic-based processes that will further cause additional work. This can be fixed with event-driven data collection. 

Data scientists can recreate brand new and real-time data by just listening to events emitted by the enterprise systems. Moreover, a data scientist can process the data with no risks of altering the enterprise data whatsoever. The enterprise system can also anonymize any kind of sensitive information or filter it. However, there is one requirement for the enterprise system: to adopt an event sourcing or event-driven.


## Event-Driven Data Exploration

Data scientists need to pre-process and filter the correct information to produce the most accurate answers. Data exploration is crucial to finding the correct combination of transformations to deliver the optimal data for the machine learning model. Thanks to a huge variety of data visualization tools, understanding data through visual representation helps us grasp its underlying connections.

Remember, events are essentials to master data!  
 
The use of events will assist data scientists in putting all data into context. The reason for any data modification cannot be discovered if there are limits to the exploration process, which should be applied to the mutable data. The updated data cannot be explored without calculating the previous value. All supplementary information events will provide patterns, habits, and highlight behavior, among other things. More qualitative data can be achieved by increasing machine learning capabilities. The enhancement of these capabilities can be further achieved with the overall process of event-driven data exploration.


## Event-Driven Data Preparation

When a product is developed, data scientists don’t design it for data machines but humans. A machine cannot understand something like literature, but the human brain can process it as easily as focused reading.

However, a human brain will have difficulty calculating massive matrix operations, while the machine will do it with ease. This tells us that machines cannot compute abstract data, but this field is humans’ expertise. To optimize machine learning, scientists need to convert this human-centric data.

Data preparation will pre-process, specialize, and clean data for each ML model. Since each model will be set to answer questions different from one another, the data coming from a single model won’t fit another’s requirements. The event-driven data technique can dramatically shorten the otherwise arduous task by incrementally producing specific data in a way that will process incoming events in continuity, making it a very valuable tool.


### Summary

While machine learning is nothing new, not all current companies have the potential to store exponential data volumes and use it adequately in equipping soon-to-be learning machines. In other words, not being able to enforce machine learning properly will prevent many, and especially smaller enterprises, from acquiring a favorable business outcome. 

 
In due time, and as technology continues to evolve, the models based on which machine learning now operates are expected to be facilitated and made available for all-size enterprises. 

 
The biggest hope researchers have in terms of sophistication of machine learning in the foreseeable future lies in making current models far more flexible and applicable. This will ultimately train respective machines to handle more than one task at a time - all by learning faster, smarter, and better.
