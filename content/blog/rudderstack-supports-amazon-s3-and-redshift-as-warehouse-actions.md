RudderStack is thrilled to announce support for Amazon storage platforms- Amazon S3 and Redshift as Warehouse Actions. The RudderStack [Warehouse Actions](https://rudderstack.com/blog/introducing-rudderstack-cloud-extract-and-warehouse-actions) feature, released in January this year, enables you to leverage your customer data residing in your data warehouse and connect your desired destinations to this enriched information.

Configuring Amazon S3 and Redshift as Warehouse Actions can easily transform these platforms into a data source for audiences and events that RudderStack can ingest and route to all of the customer tool destinations we support. 

[Sign up](https://app.rudderstack.com/signup) for free today to try these integrations, and if you do, we'd love to get your feedback via email or [Slack](https://resources.rudderstack.com/join-rudderstack-slack)! 


## Why we Decided to Support These Amazon Storage Platforms as Warehouse Actions

Data warehouse platforms hold valuable customer information (event data and other customer-related data), helping companies reconstruct their customers' behavior and further realign their scope and take important business decisions. 

S3 and Redshift are Amazon's two popular and widely-used storage services. Amazon S3 is a cloud-based object storage service that can store huge amounts of data for various use cases, including websites, mobile apps, IoT devices, and more. It helps configure complex access controls with simple management features. Amazon Redshift, on the other hand, is the fastest and fully-managed cloud data warehouse. It is cost-effective and can easily process huge amounts of structured and semi-structured data.

You can now effortlessly collect your rich, processed customer data from these platforms and send them to different third-party destinations via RudderStack without any additional coding or downtime.



## How Do Our Customers Use It?

The easiest way is to configure Amazon S3 or Redshift as a source on the RudderStack dashboard, select the correct data, and sync it to all or specific destinations.

One of our customers, [Pachyderm](https://www.pachyderm.com/), uses Warehouse Actions to [automate their onboarding emails via HubSpot integration](https://rudderstack.com/blog/introducing-rudderstack-cloud-extract-and-warehouse-actions).

## What's Next?

Along with Warehouse Actions, RudderStack also launched another cool feature, [Cloud Extract Sources](https://docs.rudderstack.com/cloud-extract-sources), that allows you to collect your raw events and data from different cloud tools like Google Analytics, Facebook Ads, and many more. We'll not stop here and continue developing and expanding our integrations' catalog to ease your customer workflows.

RudderStack currently supports over 20 sources, including [Warehouse Actions](https://docs.rudderstack.com/warehouse-actions), [Cloud Extracts](https://docs.rudderstack.com/cloud-extract-sources), and [Event streams](https://docs.rudderstack.com/rudderstack-event-streams). We also support over 80 [destinations](https://docs.rudderstack.com/destinations) and add a new one every two weeks, so be sure to look at the other [integrations](https://rudderstack.com/integration/) we support.
