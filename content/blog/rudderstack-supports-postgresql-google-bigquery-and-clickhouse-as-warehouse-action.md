We're happy to announce a few more additions to our [Warehouse Actions](https://rudderstack.com/blog/rudderstack-warehouse-actions-unlocks-the-data-in-your-warehouse) suite. [PostgreSQL](https://docs.rudderstack.com/warehouse-actions/postgresql), [Google BigQuery](https://docs.rudderstack.com/warehouse-actions/google-bigquery), and [ClickHouse](https://docs.rudderstack.com/warehouse-actions/clickhouse) have been added as Warehouse Sources. Integrate with these warehouses to connect your customer data and send them to your favorite third-party destinations securely via [RudderStack](http://www.rudderstack.com/).

[Sign up](https://app.rudderstack.com/signup) for free today to try these integrations, and if you do, we'd love to get your feedback via email or [Slack](https://resources.rudderstack.com/join-rudderstack-slack)! 


## Why we Decided to Support These Warehouses as Integrations

Data Warehouses are the single source of truth for all organizations, great and small! A huge amount of data enters them, but as it is processed, only some data get picked up for analysis. When a business wants to look for answers to what went wrong during a process or what your business lacks, it is at that time they seek evidence within the data warehouse. 

Why look later? With Warehouse Actions, you can make your warehouse an active part of your business decision-making. 

[PostgreSQL](https://rudderstack.com/integration/postgresql-source/), [Google BigQuery](https://rudderstack.com/integration/google-bigquery-source/), and [ClickHous](https://rudderstack.com/integration/clickhouse-source/)e are popular data warehouses, each with its unique ability. [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) is a popular and open-source object-relational database known for its robustness, reliability, and performance. [ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.tech/) is an open-source, column-oriented DBMS and is fast, fault-tolerant, highly scalable. It is built for high-performance and generates analytical reports using SQL queries in real-time. [Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery) is a fully-managed cloud data warehouse that can store and query huge amounts of data in no time. It is serverless, cost-effective, highly scalable, and is built to analyze massive datasets.

Warehouse Actions enables you to act quickly with the already processed data within your data warehouse, set it as a source, route your data to third-party destinations, and derive meaningful insights.  


## How Do Our Customers Use It? 


Here are a few use cases of how customers use these Warehouses as sources:



*   **Source of truth**: Businesses use data to power their campaign, personalized messaging, and much more. Connecting with your data warehouse allows you to stay close to the source of true information about your customers.
*   **Real-time data updates**: Data warehouses can process huge and complex queries in real-time and have fresh and ready-to-go data. So, syncing your tools with your data warehouse helps customers yield the most recent updates about your product/ customer.
*   **Data security:** Data within these popular warehouses (PostgreSQL, ClickHouse, Google BigQuery) is centralized and properly secured, which reduces the risk of a data breach. With recent cases of businesses affected by data breaches, customers ensure total security with data warehouses. 


## What's Next?

RudderStack will continue to add more warehouses to our collection to ease your customer workflows. We also conduct [live Q&A webinars](https://resources.rudderstack.com/rudderstack-webinar-registration) with our customers to share their experiences of using different RudderStack features.
