## Why we Added Support for Pendo and Marketo

RudderStack continually strives to partner with third-party integrations that customers love and use for their data activation use-cases.

**Pendo** is a popular product analytics platform built specifically for software development companies to understand their customers better. Pendo helps product teams easily understand product usage, onboard new users, collect feedback, and release new in-app features without requiring any additional coding. Pendo also allows you to identify customer interactions that lead to customer retention and expansion.
