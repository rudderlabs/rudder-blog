RudderStack is proud to announce support for Apache Kafka as a destination. By adding Apache Kafka as a destination, you can build real-time data pipelines and scalable streaming applications with ease. You can also integrate with the popular event sources (PostgreSQL, Amazon S3, Elasticsearch, and more!) and store your event streams in a secure, distributed, and fault-tolerant manner.

Browse through our [documentation](https://docs.rudderstack.com/destinations/kafka) to give this integration a try. Feel free to contact us if you come across any bugs, or if you have any suggestions for improvement.

**Partnership with Confluent**
------------------------------

To take things a notch further, we have partnered with Confluent to bring you an officially certified RudderStack Connector for Apache Kafka. You can follow the [official Confluent documentation](https://www.confluent.io/hub/rudderstack/kafka-connect-rudderstack) to download this plugin and get started!

We would love to hear from you if you come across any issues while working with the connector.

**Why We Added Apache Kafka as a Destination**
----------------------------------------------

Apache Kafka is used in numerous applications such as website activity tracking, log aggregation, metrics collection and monitoring, error recovery, and much more. Kafka also has interesting implications for applications built around the Internet of Things, microservices, and cloud-native architectures in general. Kafka can also be a backing store for implementing scalable microservices using domain-driven design concepts like CQRS and event sourcing.

Seamless, reliable delivery of customer events from the specified sources to preferred destinations is highly essential. A huge amount of data is generated every second, and it can be tapped efficiently for finer and much-personalized analytics. Apache Kafka gives you this efficiency – by integrating with hundreds of event sources with high performance and scalability. It also supports multiple subscribers with ease and auto-balances consumers during an event failure, making it highly reliable.

Many organizations around the world use Apache Kafka for various mission-critical applications, stream analytics, and high-scale data integration – and this is one of the most important reasons why we added support for Apache Kafka. 

**What’s Next?**
----------------

We at RudderStack are committed to helping you make the most of your event data via the integrations we develop. With the new RudderStack Apache Kafka Connector, you can seamlessly and securely route event data to your desired destinations in no time. As Apache Kafka evolves with new features for uninterrupted and up-to-date customer experiences, we plan to be in sync with its development to always ensure 100% support and compatibility.
