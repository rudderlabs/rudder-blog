## **Why we Added PostHog as a Destination**

PostHog offers scalable product analytics while giving you full control over your data. It allows you to analyze how customers interact with your applications and website via the **Event AutoCapture** feature.

You can also watch live session recordings to know exactly where your users get stuck or what bugs they encounter. This  massively improves customer experience and stickiness. PostHog is open source and you can easily self-host the platform. This makes it a good fit for B2C applications and enterprise users.

With PostHog, you can unlock powerful product analytics features while eliminating the data protection risks and costs of sending customer data to third parties.
