We're happy to announce that [RudderStack](http://www.rudderstack.com) now [supports Google Analytics 4 as a destination](https://rudderstack.com/integration/google-analytics-4/). Google Analytics 4 is the latest property with better instrumentation and reports than the previous version (popularly known as [Universal Analytics](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/10220206)).  

If you’re looking to migrate to Google Analytics 4, it’s a great time to unify your analytics data collection using RudderStack. You can sign up for free to try out the integration, and if you do, we’d love to get your feedback via email or [Slack](https://resources.rudderstack.com/join-rudderstack-slack)! 


## Why we Added Google Analytics 4 as a Destination

We prioritized the GA4 integration not only because of customer requests but also because of the platform's [widespread adoption](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/ta-googleanalytics). Google’s benchmark service takes a big step forward with its fourth-generation release, and we’re proud to be the only customer data pipeline currently supporting GA4 as a destination. 

[Google Analytics 4](https://blog.google/products/marketingplatform/analytics/new_google_analytics) helps you get a complete understanding of your customers across different devices and platforms. Powered by Google's state-of-the-art machine learning models, GA4 can automatically notify you of meaningful trends in your data. 

GA4 can measure both app and website performance together, allowing you to include conversions from YouTube engaged views that occur in-app and on the web. So, you can view conversions from YouTube video views. Furthermore, you can view conversions from Google and non-Google paid channels. View conversions from Google search, email, social media, etc., all in one place. This data helps you to understand the overall performance and impact of your marketing campaigns.

GA4 includes simplified reporting to help you track marketing insights in the parts of the customer journey you are interested in. GA4 also helps you anticipate future customer actions, which assists you in responding to rising customer expectations. 

Google Analytics 4 is built to adapt to the evolving industry, with or without cookies or identifiers. In the future, GA4 will also include **conversion modeling** to fill gaps formed by incomplete data. We look forward to providing destination support for GA users as Universal Analytics users migrate to GA4 and new users adopt the service.
