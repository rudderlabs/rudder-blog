Back in November, [we launched our free-tier, RudderStack Cloud Free](https://rudderstack.com/blog/start-building-a-better-cdp-for-free-with-rudderstack-cloud-free), which lets users send up to 500,000 events per month through Event Stream - our event streaming feature. A lot of people liked it. We’ve had thousands of data engineers sign-up since then.

In January, [we launched Warehouse Actions and Cloud Extract](https://rudderstack.com/blog/introducing-rudderstack-cloud-extract-and-warehouse-actions) – our reverse-ETL and ELT features. These features made RudderStack a complete data pipeline solution because it could build pipelines for all three common types of data movement:



*   Event streaming 
*   ELT
*   Reverse-ETL 

The ability to use all three gives you incredible flexibility to solve difficult problems with your data. Having a single tool that supports all three – [RudderStack](https://rudderstack.com/) – simplifies building and managing your customer data stack (as opposed to using 3 separate vendors or building 3 internal pipelines). 

Until now, our free-tier didn’t include Warehouse Actions or Cloud Extract. Today, we’re fixing that. 

**RudderStack Warehouse Actions and Cloud Extract are now available in RudderStack Cloud Free!**


## Send Rich Analysis from Your Warehouse to Your Entire Customer Data Stack with Warehouse Actions

RudderStack Warehouse Actions is our [reverse-ETL](https://rudderstack.com/blog/reverse-etl-is-just-another-data-pipeline) feature. It turns your warehouse into a data source, translating rows into configurable JSON payloads that can be sent to hundreds of tools across your stack, from Salesforce to Zendesk to Kafka and even webhooks.

You choose the data you want to send and the tools you want to send it to, and it’s inserted into the event stream! Because we load each row into the same payload format as data flowing through Event Stream, there’s no additional configuration required for downstream destinations and you can leverage our Transformations feature to modify the payload by destination. 

Our customers use Warehouse Actions  to solve use cases like:



*   Audience segmentation
*   Recommendation engines
*   Personalization
*   Lead scoring/tagging
*   Enrich events and profiles
*   Cleansing and routing internal events
*   Routing non-customer data (i.e., shipping data from carriers)

**Note:** Warehouse Actions is limited to one connection and 10k events/month in RudderStack Cloud Free.

## Go Beyond Event Streaming. Build Cloud-to-Warehouse ELT Pipelines with Cloud Extract.

RudderStack Cloud Extract is our ELT feature. It gives you out-of-the-box integrations with popular cloud sources – such as Salesforce, Customer.io, Google AdWords, and even Google Sheets – that make it easy to build cloud-to-warehouse pipelines.

Cloud Extract helps break down silos that form around the tools your teams use – such as your CRM, your customer support system, the ad platforms your marketing teams use, etc. It lets you access and integrate data from all the tools your teams use to expand the types of analysis you can do and make the insights you derive more specific, accurate, and actionable.

**Note:** Cloud Extract is limited to three active connections and 500k events/month in RudderStack Cloud Free.
