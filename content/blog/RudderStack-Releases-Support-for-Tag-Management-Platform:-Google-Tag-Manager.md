We are delighted to announce RudderStack’s successful integration with Google Tag Manager – the world’s leading tag management platform used by many businesses. Once added as an integration, you can send your customer events to the Google Tag Manager (GTM) data layer directly using RudderStack’s JavaScript SDK.

We encourage you to try out this integration and [contact us](https://rudderstack.com/contact/) in case you come across any issues or bugs. Suggestions for improvement, as well as any feedback on the integration, is also welcome!  

**Why we Decided to Support a Tag Management Platform as a Destination**
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tag management platforms play a crucial role in optimizing the tracking code and ensuring that your website operates with optimum speed, security, and efficiency. We believe that the process of tracking and collecting customer event data should be speedy but also safe and reliable. It was our motivation for developing the integration with Google Tag Manager.  

We have made configuring and adding the Google Tag Manager integration on the RudderStack dashboard a straightforward process. All you need to do is add the GTM Container ID from your GTM dashboard, enable the native SDK, and you are good to go! 

Once the integration is enabled, Google Tag Manager loads on any page where the RudderStack snippet is initialized and `rudderstack.page` gets called on the client-side. You can also use our native JavaScript SDK to populate the GTM data layer with the tracking events. As an alternative, you can also add RudderStack as a custom HTML tag, which you can call through Google Tag Manager.   

**What You Can do With a Tag Management Platform**
--------------------------------------------------

Marketing teams and product managers usually want a simple, secure, and reliable tag management system that allows them to work with tags that are critical to their business. Some of these use-cases include improving page load times, implementing efficient analytics, and streamlining your overall product’s workflow. Using tools such as Google Tag Manager allows you to do all this and much more. 

Google Tag Manager allows you to create and update your tags and deploy them with speed and ease. In the process, it will enable you to eliminate the need for repetitive code changes to manage these tags. With features such as tag sequencing, multi-environment testing, and malware scanning, GTM ensures safe and reliable tag management and debugging. 

With tag management platforms such as Google Tag Manager, managing your tracking code becomes much easier and efficient. Along with increased website speed, it allows for agile decision-making and very little development work – making it a must-have in every marketing tech stack.  

**What’s Next**
---------------

After successful integration with Google Tag Manager, we plan to add more tag management platforms as destinations soon. Also, we are committed to ensuring that the GTM integration is always up to date, with support for the latest cutting-edge features GTM has to offer.
