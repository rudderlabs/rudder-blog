## Proposify’s Customer Data Stack

*   **Data Warehouse**

    Amazon Redshift

*   **Data Transformation**

    Marketo, Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, Intercom, Google Tag Manager, Heap.io, Salesforce, Slack


_“Before RudderStack, instrumentation of the new ‘destinations’ for the marketing website required either Google Tag Manager or actual code deployments, thus, doubling our efforts. Now, we can just add the destinations in RudderStack and skip all the manual deployments.”_



   **- Max Werner, Data Operations Manager, Proposify**

As a data-driven company, Proposify uses both the event and non-event data from various sources to make business decisions around their product and marketing strategies. They primarily have two kinds of data users - the operations team that keeps the ETL data pipelines working and the data consumers who use different downstream tools that leverage data fed by these pipelines for their various activation use-cases.


## Simplified Instrumentation and Real-Time Data Collection

Before implementing RudderStack as a part of their customer data stack, Proposify was facing major challenges in instrumenting their web and mobile apps. App blockers were proving to be another obstacle, so they mainly had to rely on server-side event streaming. 

Also, tracking anonymous user events got quite expensive, and linking them with their website event data required extensive manual coding. All these problems meant their data team could not collect and utilize all of their data without a significant cost and technical overhead.

With RudderStack’s SDKs, Proposify’s data team could seamlessly capture all their cross-platform events through simple, easy-to-use integrations. They can instrument new destinations in RudderStack to route all their marketing website events without relying on tag managers or actual code deployments. Also, as there are no cost-based volume limitations, they can collect all the anonymous user data, link with their customer events, and route all of this information into their warehouse and various downstream tools.


## Standardized Data Sync and Delivery Across the Entire Customer Data Stack

Before RudderStack was a part of their infrastructure, all of Proposify’s data was highly siloed. The same data would be present in different states in different systems. Fixing this required manual double-checking or importing fresh data from the warehouse, delaying a lot of marketing, sales, and product initiatives.

By implementing RudderStack, Proposify eliminated all of these problems by standardizing real-time data synchronization across their entire customer data stack. They leveraged RudderStack’s **[Event Stream](https://rudderstack.com/#event_stream)**, **[Cloud Extract](https://rudderstack.com/#cloud_extract)**, and **[Warehouse Actions](https://rudderstack.com/#warehouse_actions)** features to ensure data from all their sources - including websites, mobile, and third-party cloud apps - was captured and delivered to their warehouse and other third-party tools.

With reliable, consistent, and standardized data at their disposal, Proposify’s teams don’t have to worry about data parity. They can make data-driven decisions around the product and other key aspects surrounding marketing and sales confidently.


## Activating Data Through Product and Marketing Analytics

With RudderStack, Proposify can mirror all their marketing automation, CRM, customer support, and payment data into their data warehouse. This data is then processed and modeled to provide insights to various business units.

For instance, by leveraging the enriched warehouse data, Proposify’s product team can accurately determine how their customers are using the product. These insights allow them to understand user journeys and optimize the product features accordingly. 

With all the data at their disposal, the marketing and sales teams have access to all the top-of-the-funnel insights. They can identify the channels that drive the most leads and conversions and track the impact of various marketing campaigns on the revenue. This allows them to optimize their marketing spend, design a robust sales funnel, and build better marketing campaigns that boost their user conversion and retention rates.

_“With RudderStack, top-of-the-funnel insights is a solvable problem now.”_



   **- Max Werner, Data Operations Manager, Proposify**
