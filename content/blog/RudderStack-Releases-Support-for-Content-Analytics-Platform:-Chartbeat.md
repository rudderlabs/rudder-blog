[RudderStack](https://rudderstack.com/) is proud to announce that it supports Chartbeat. Chartbeat is the leading content measurement, analytics, and optimization platform for businesses. With this integration, you can send events directly to Chartbeat via our native web SDKs using the RudderStack APIs.

We encourage you to try out this integration and [contact us](https://rudderstack.com/contact/) if you have any queries or issues to report. We also welcome any feedback or suggestions for improvement.  

**Why we decided to support a content analytics platform as destinations for RudderStack**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RudderStack specializes in tracking and collecting event data and routing it to the desired destinations in real-time. This event data includes the user’s overall web and in-app activity. Content analytics tools use such information to get detailed insights into the incoming traffic, the source, etc. RudderStack takes care of the format and structure of the event data before forwarding it to the destination. Hence, the content analytics platforms can pick up the data directly to give you the insights you need. Thus, we felt that the integration with such platforms was required. This would simplify the overall workflow of the content teams to a great extent.  

You can send the user and website activity-related information using this integration. You can also configure RudderStack’s SDK to use Chartbeat’s video analytics script to track and capture video interactions seamlessly. Once you enable this setting, the script starts capturing various events of the HTML5 videos embedded within the `<video> </video>` tags.  

**What you can do with the content analytics platforms**
--------------------------------------------------------

Content analytics platforms such as Chartbeat specialize in delivering real-time insights and performance metrics for your content. Companies design these tools content teams in mind and aim to improve audience engagement, increase customer retention, and improve your brand value. These tools track and analyze your website traffic. The resulting insights allow you to pinpoint the content that is bringing in the most traffic or the source from where you are getting the most visitors.  

Chartbeat also offers video analytics capabilities that allow you to analyze your videos and identify which videos are capturing maximum user attention so that you can promote them more effectively.

**What’s next?**
----------------

RudderStack is an [open-source product](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-server), and we believe that it complements the content analytics platforms such as Chartbeat perfectly. An integration with RudderStack would mean that Chartbeat gets the most up-to-date, adequately formatted data to work on. At the same time, the data privacy and security aspects are also something that we take seriously, so you don’t have to worry about that as well. We are committed to ensuring that all the future releases and new offerings of Chartbeat, including content and video analytics, are supported by RudderStack.
