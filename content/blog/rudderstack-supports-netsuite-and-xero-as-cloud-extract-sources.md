RudderStack is happy to announce support for [NetSuite](https://rudderstack.com/integration/netsuite-source/) and [Xero](https://rudderstack.com/integration/xero-source/) as new Cloud Extract sources. Now you can easily integrate with these Cloud Extract Sources to ingest your customer data and send them to your warehouses or your favorite third-party destinations securely via [RudderStack](http://www.rudderstack.com/).

[Sign up](https://app.rudderstack.com/signup) for free to try NetSuite and Xero, and if you do, we'd love to get your feedback via e-mail or [Slack](https://resources.rudderstack.com/join-rudderstack-slack)! 


## Why we Added NetSuite and Xero as Cloud Extract Sources

**[NetSuite](https://docs.rudderstack.com/cloud-extract-sources/netsuite)** is a popular cloud-based business management suite that offers ERP, CRM, and e-commerce solutions all in a single platform. **[Xero](https://docs.rudderstack.com/cloud-extract-sources/xero)** is a cloud-based accounting software ideal for small and medium-sized businesses, accountants, and book-keepers and helps them manage invoicing, inventory, purchasing, expenses, and more.

By adding NetSuite and Xero as Cloud Extract Sources, you can easily ingest customer data residing within these tools and route them to other third-party tools for further analysis. You can also route the data within your data warehouses for analysis. This ensures you do not create unnecessary data silos on your NetSuite and Xero and utilize all of the data for customer analysis. 



## How do our Customers use it?

Raw customer events data from NetSuite helps you surface questions about your ERP and CRM data and go beyond NetSuite's dashboards. You can also collect Saved Searches data and analyze them with SQL within your data warehouse. Similarly, the customer data from Xero will help you analyze your finances, learn if your budget is well spent in marketing, and also understand your customer acquisition costs (CAC).


## What's Next?

Along with Cloud Extract Sources, RudderStack also launched another cool feature, [Warehouse Actions](https://rudderstack.com/blog/introducing-rudderstack-cloud-extract-and-warehouse-actions), which routes the already processed, enriched customer data residing in your data warehouse to your desired destinations. We also conduct [live Q&A webinars](https://resources.rudderstack.com/rudderstack-webinar-registration) with our customers to share their experiences of using different RudderStack features.

RudderStack supports more than 20 sources, which includes [Cloud Extracts](https://docs.rudderstack.com/cloud-extract-sources), [Warehouse Actions](https://docs.rudderstack.com/warehouse-actions), and [Event streams](https://docs.rudderstack.com/rudderstack-event-streams). We also support over 80 [destinations](https://rudderstack.com/integration/?q=&hPP=100&idx=wp_posts_integration&p=0&dFR%5Btaxonomies.integration_types%5D%5B0%5D=Destinations&is_v=1) and add a new integration every two weeks.
