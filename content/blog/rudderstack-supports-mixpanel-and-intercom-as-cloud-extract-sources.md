RudderStack is happy to announce two new additions to its Cloud Extract Sources, **Mixpanel** and **Intercom**. Integrate with these Cloud Extract Sources to ingest your customer data and send them to your warehouses or your favorite third-party destinations securely via [RudderStack](http://www.rudderstack.com/).

[Sign up](https://app.rudderstack.com/signup) for free today to try these integrations, and if you do, we'd love to get your feedback via e-mail or [Slack](https://resources.rudderstack.com/join-rudderstack-slack)! 


## Why RudderStack Decided to Support Mixpanel and Intercom as Cloud Extract Sources

[Mixpanel](https://rudderstack.com/integration/mixpanel-source/) is a popular analytics platform that helps you to track user actions with your application. It also offers various tools (in-app A/B testing, user survey forms, more) for targeted business communication and engagement with your customers. 

[Intercom](https://rudderstack.com/integration/intercom-source/) is a real-time business messaging platform that enables you to manage all your customer life cycle activities on a single platform.

RudderStack already supports [Mixpanel](https://rudderstack.com/integration/mixpanel/) and [Intercom](https://rudderstack.com/integration/intercom/) as destinations that help you securely route your customer data from your data sources to these integrations. Adding Mixpanel and Intercom as Cloud Extract Sources enables you to collect raw customer data and further route these raw datasets to supported [data warehouses](https://docs.rudderstack.com/data-warehouse-integrations) (Snowflake, Google BigQuery, Amazon Redshift, ClickHouse, and PostgreSQL) and third-party destinations for analysis. 


## How do our Customers Use It?

Customers can use Cloud Extract Sources to build seamless ELT pipelines from your Mixpanel and Intercom applications to your data warehouse or your third-party customer tools. You can easily combine customer event data generated by digital touchpoints with non-event customer data from different cloud applications.

One of our clients, Proposify, uses the Cloud Extract feature to integrate their GSC data (relevant search trends, keyword rankings, and landing page performance) into their Redshift warehouse and data modeling workflows for a complete overview of their acquisition efforts. 


## What's Next?

RudderStack conducts [live Q&A webinars](https://resources.rudderstack.com/rudderstack-webinar-registration) with our customers to share their experiences of using different RudderStack features. However, just like the Cloud Extract Sources, we will continue to add more features and support for more Cloud Extract sources in the coming months. So, stay tuned!
