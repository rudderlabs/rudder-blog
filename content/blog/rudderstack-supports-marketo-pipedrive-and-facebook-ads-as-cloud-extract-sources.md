We're happy to announce support for three new Cloud Extract Sources, **Marketo**, **Pipedrive**, and **Facebook Ads**. [RudderStack](http://www.rudderstack.com/) platform enables you to ingest customer data from these sources and securely route them to your favorite third-party destinations or into your warehouse. 

Try these integrations yourself! [Sign up](https://app.rudderstack.com/signup) for free today and explore these and other similar cloud extract sources. If you try them, we'd love to get your feedback via email or [Slack](https://resources.rudderstack.com/join-rudderstack-slack)!


## Why we Decided to Support These Platforms as Cloud Extract Sources

RudderStack already supports [Marketo and Facebook Ads as destinations](https://rudderstack.com/integration?q=&hPP=100&idx=wp_posts_integration&p=0&is_v=1), which help you ingest your data from multiple data sources and route them to Marketo and Facebook Ads for downstream customer data activation. 

[Marketo](https://docs.rudderstack.com/cloud-extract-sources/marketo) is a popular marketing automation platform that enables you to engage with the right audience via behavioral targeting. It helps you deliver personalized and automated marketing campaigns to enhance customer engagement and experience.

[Pipedrive](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SovZRXk3_3tiFBqwII9DFvQa8Zr3s0sxvCZYRDXion0/edit#) is a sales CRM and pipeline management tool to manage your leads, track customer communications, and more. It enables you to track and manage your sales funnel and also integrate it with multiple apps like Intercom, Mailchimp, and more.

[Facebook Ads](https://docs.rudderstack.com/cloud-extract-sources/facebook-ads) is a popular online advertising platform that enables you to build and run cross-device marketing campaigns, track their performance with easy-to-read reports. You can also create, publish and purchase ads across all Facebook platforms such as Instagram, Facebook Messenger, etc.

Having [Marketo](https://rudderstack.com/integration/marketo-source/), [Pipedrive](https://rudderstack.com/integration/pipedrive-source/), and [Facebook Ads](https://rudderstack.com/integration/facebook-ads-source/) as Cloud Extract Sources lets you access and integrate data from your product, sales, marketing, support, and finance teams' cloud tools (and databases/data lakes). This data access further helps expand your teams' types of analysis and make the insights your teams derive more specific, accurate, and actionable.


## How do our Customers Use It? 



RudderStack [Cloud Extract feature](https://rudderstack.com/blog/rudderstack-cloud-extract-makes-cloud-to-warehouse-pipelines-easy) enables customers to combine data from your different customer teams residing in Marketo, Pipedrive, and Facebook Ads and send them to your warehouses or other third-party customer tools to answer critical business questions. 


You can combine the data ingested from Cloud Extract sources with data gathered using the RudderStack [Event Streams](https://docs.rudderstack.com/rudderstack-event-streams) or [Warehouse Actions](https://rudderstack.com/blog/rudderstack-warehouse-actions-unlocks-the-data-in-your-warehouse) feature. For example, you can combine product usage behavior using Event Streams and campaigns performance data from Facebook Ads or Marketo, and then combine both the datasets in your warehouse for analysis. 

To know more about the Cloud Extract feature, you can watch a [quick product walkthrough](https://rudderstack.com/video-library/cloud-extract-feature-walk-through/) curated by our company experts along with an example implementation.
