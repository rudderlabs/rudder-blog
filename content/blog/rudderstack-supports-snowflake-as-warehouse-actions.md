A few months ago, we [disclosed](https://rudderstack.com/blog/the-stack-of-the-future-building-a-warehouse-first-cdp-on-snowflake-using-rudderstack) a little about adding [Snowflake](https://rudderstack.com/integration/snowflake-source/) as a Warehouse Source. The wait is over! RudderStack proudly presents a great addition to our Warehouse Actions pool - Snowflake. 

Snowflake is a popular cloud-based data warehouse offered as **Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)**. It offers businesses all the features similar to modern data warehouses, including scalability, ease of use, secure data access, accelerated analytics capabilities, and much more.


## Why Did we Decide to Add Snowflake as Warehouse Actions?

There are multiple warehouses to choose from, but [Snowflake](https://docs.rudderstack.com/warehouse-actions/snowflake) stands out from the rest because it logically separates storage and computes resources. This excellent feature significantly reduces overall data storage and processing costs.

RudderStack already supports [Snowflake as a destination](https://docs.rudderstack.com/data-warehouse-integrations/snowflake), which means you can easily ingest your customer data from multiple customer tools into Snowflake in real-time, using RudderStack. Further, you can run user queries on Snowflake via RudderStack and pass the results as events back to RudderStack using Snowflake Warehouse Actions. This enables sending Snowflake-enriched customer event data to your third-party marketing and analytics destinations for more advanced activation use-cases.

Snowflake goes beyond a typical data warehouse and helps unlock your data's full potential without creating any data silos.  \



## How do our Customers use it?

Snowflake Warehouse Actions allows customers to route all Snowflake-processed event data to different third-party analytics tools for further analysis in the desired format. 

Customers use Snowflake data for the following:



*   Running customer engagement programs through tools such as [Braze](https://www.braze.com/)
*   Performing product analytics through tools such as [Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com/), [PostHog](https://posthog.com/), and [Iterable](https://iterable.com/)
*   Leveraging attribution tools such as [Adjust](https://www.adjust.com/), [AppsFlyer](https://www.appsflyer.com/), [Kochava](https://www.kochava.com/). 

Customers sync Snowflake as a warehouse source to over 80 destinations supported by RudderStack.
