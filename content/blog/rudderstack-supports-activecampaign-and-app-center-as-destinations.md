We're excited to announce support for two new destinations, [ActiveCampaign](https://rudderstack.com/integration/activecampaign/) and [App Center](https://rudderstack.com/integration/app-center/). Now you can securely send your real-time customer event data to these destinations via [RudderStack](http://www.rudderstack.com/) and get full flexibility and control over your event data.  

[Sign up](https://app.rudderstack.com/signup) for free to try these integrations, and if you do, we'd love to get your feedback via email or [Slack](https://resources.rudderstack.com/join-rudderstack-slack)! 


## Why we Decided to Support These Integrations

[ActiveCampaign](https://docs.rudderstack.com/destinations/active-campaign) is a popular customer experience automation platform that helps you connect and engage with your customers. It lets you virtually set up any automation task, including triggered email campaigns, automated segmentation, dynamic email content, and much more, making it the ideal choice for marketing and automation. 

On the other hand, [App Center](https://docs.rudderstack.com/destinations/appcenter) is a cross-platform build automation and management platform, which helps you manage your applicationsâ€™ lifecycle. It helps you configure quick-builds, build servers locally, and avoid complex code configurations without extensive coding.


## How Do Our Customers Use It?


### Automated Workflows with Activecampaign

Customers use ActiveCampaign to automate, segment and personalize communications across different parts of the business. Companies use it to track custom funnels and integrate with social profiles for lead scoring based on interactions, interest, site activity, and social media details.


### Manage App Lifecycle and More with App Center \


With App Center, customers track usage and crash data analytics, push notifications, and data synchronization, among other services. Customers also integrate it with multiple mobile app technologies.


## What's Next?

RudderStack is an open-source product, and we will continue to develop multiple integrations to ease your customer workflows. We are continuously working on adding more sources and destinations soon.

We currently support over 20 sources, including [Warehouse Actions](https://docs.rudderstack.com/warehouse-actions), [Cloud Extracts](https://docs.rudderstack.com/cloud-extract-sources), and [Event streams](https://docs.rudderstack.com/rudderstack-event-streams). We also support over 80 [destinations](https://docs.rudderstack.com/destinations) and add a new one every two weeks, so be sure to look at the other [integrations](https://rudderstack.com/integration/) we support.
