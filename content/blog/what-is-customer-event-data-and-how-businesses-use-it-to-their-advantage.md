But, event data might help straighten out this curve.

Event data means tracking users through harvesting data on them, be it their check-in location, home address, the ads they use, the sites they access, the privacy settings they change, and their overall online experience.

Various mediums, such as YouTube, Google, and all social media platforms, make the most common gathering spots for potential business customers. There are many ways users engage on social media before purchasing a product or a service, including reading valuable product reviews, comparing prices, and interacting with experienced buyers.

However, today, businesses have learned the ropes of smart data gathering and use event data as a great source of information, precision, and accuracy in evaluating customer behaviors. Therefore, marketers can redesign their old strategies to successfully cope with the growing number of consumers and grasp the complexity of buying online.
